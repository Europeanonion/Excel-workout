# Excel Workout Beta Testing Guide

## Personal Testing Notes

This document serves as a guide for beta testing the Excel Workout app. Since you're testing it yourself, this document will help track what needs to be tested and any findings.

## Core Functionality to Test

### 1. Excel File Upload & Parsing
- [ ] Upload and parse advanced-workout.xlsx template
- [ ] Test if all exercises, sets, reps display correctly
- [ ] Test with files that have different formats/structures
- [ ] Verify that error handling works with malformed files

### 2. Program Navigation
- [ ] Navigate between workout days within the same week
- [ ] Navigate between different weeks
- [ ] Verify that all program data renders correctly
- [ ] Check navigation performance with larger workout programs

### 3. Workout Session Tracking
- [ ] Start a new workout session
- [ ] Record weights and completed exercises
- [ ] Save session progress
- [ ] Resume an in-progress workout
- [ ] Complete a workout and verify storage

### 4. Offline Functionality
- [ ] Load the app and disable network connection
- [ ] Verify all previously loaded programs are accessible
- [ ] Create and save a workout session while offline
- [ ] Reconnect and verify data syncs properly with Firebase

### 5. Performance Testing
- [ ] Monitor initial load time
- [ ] Check memory usage during extended use
- [ ] Test on different devices if possible
- [ ] Verify lazy loading of images and components works

## Known Issues & Workarounds

- If Excel parsing fails, try simplifying your Excel structure (avoid merged cells)
- Firebase authentication might timeout if network is unstable - retry usually resolves this
- IndexedDB storage has limitations on mobile Safari - stay under 50MB total storage
