## Active Decisions

*   Using Firebase (Firestore) for backend data storage and synchronization.
*   Using IndexedDB (with the `idb` library) for offline storage.
*   Using a feature-based architecture for the React codebase.
*   Using dynamic header mapping for flexible Excel file parsing.
*   Using UUIDs to uniquely identify workout programs.
*   Using a timestamp-based merge strategy with user override for conflict resolution.
