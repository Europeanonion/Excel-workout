## Current Session
2025-02-26 18:19 UTC
Analyzed existing file structure and content, updated memory bank.

## Recent Changes
- Created core documentation structure
- Established product context baseline
- Analyzed existing file structure and content
- Updated memory bank files (activeContext.md, progress.md, decisionLog.md)
- Identified failing tests and created plan to address them

## Open Questions
1. Confirm long-term data storage strategy
2. Validate Excel parsing requirements
3. Determine approach for fixing failing tests

## Current Goals
1. Fix failing tests in the following order:
   - ExcelUploader.test.tsx
   - ProgramList.test.tsx
   - WorkoutDetails.test.tsx
   - WorkoutSession.test.tsx
   - App.test.tsx
2. Implement Firebase integration for data synchronization
3. Enhance WorkoutSession component with set tracking, progress indicators, and note-taking
4. Implement proper state management
5. Address security vulnerabilities in dependencies

### Findings from Codebase Analysis
*   **File Organization:**
    *   The codebase is well-organized and follows the project conventions.
    *   **Suggestion:** Export helper functions and sub-components in `index.ts` files to allow for more flexibility and reusability.
*   **Dependency Flow:**
    *   The dependency flow seems correct, and there are no obvious circular dependencies or unused imports.
*   **Code Flow:**
    *   The code flow seems logical and consistent across the main components.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   The error handling is consistent, but the error messages could be improved by using a more generic error message and providing more context in the console log.
*   **Modularity and Maintainability:**
    *   The codebase is modular and maintainable.
    *   There are no `TODO` comments in the code.
*   **Documentation and Comments:**
    *   The codebase is well-documented, and the comments explain complex logic where needed.
    *   **Suggestion:** Add more JSDoc comments to the functions and components to provide more information about their purpose, parameters, and return values.
*   **Testing Coverage:**
    *   There are several failing tests that need to be addressed.
        *   `src/components/ExcelUploader/ExcelUploader.test.tsx`: 3 failing tests related to error handling for invalid file types and parsing errors.
        *   `src/components/ProgramList/ProgramList.test.tsx`: 2 failing tests related to rendering the program list.
        *   `src/App.test.tsx`: 4 failing tests related to routing.
    *   There are warnings about deprecated `ReactDOMTestUtils.act` and React Router future flags.

*   **`src/App.tsx` Analysis:**
    *   **Structure:** The `App` component is the main entry point, using `react-router-dom` for routing.
    *   **State:** Manages `message`, `messageType`, and `refreshTrigger` using `useState`.
    *   **Callbacks:** Uses `useCallback` for `handleUploadSuccess` and `handleUploadError`.
    *   **IndexedDB Initialization:** Initializes IndexedDB using `initDB` within a `useEffect` hook.
    *   **Routing:** Defines routes for the home page ("/") and workout details page ("/program/:programId").
    *   **Accessibility:** Includes `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"` for message display.
    *   **Issue:** Failing tests in `App.test.tsx`. The nature of these failures needs further investigation as the current tests don't directly test routing, despite the previous mention of routing-related issues.
    *   **Suggestion:** Add JSDoc comments.

*   **`src/components/ExcelUploader/ExcelUploader.tsx` Analysis:**
    *   **Structure:** Functional component using `useState` and `useCallback`.
    *   **Props:** Accepts `onUploadSuccess` and `onUploadError` callbacks.
    *   **State:** `isLoading` and `error`.
    *   **`handleFileChange`:** Handles file selection, validation, parsing, and error handling.
    *   **Accessibility:** Uses `label`, `aria-label`, `aria-describedby`, `role="region"`, `role="alert"`, and `aria-live="polite"`.
    *   **Styling:** Uses CSS Modules.
    *   **Issue:** The tests `handles invalid file type` and `handles parsing errors` in `ExcelUploader.test.tsx` are likely failing. These tests check for both the `onUploadError` callback and the inline error display, but the component only displays the inline error if `onUploadError` is NOT provided.
    *   **Suggestion:** Add JSDoc comments.
    *   **Suggestion:** Improve error messages to be more user-friendly.

*   **`src/components/ProgramList/ProgramList.tsx` Analysis:**
    *   **Structure:** Functional component using `useState` and `useEffect`.
    *   **State:** `programs`, `isLoading`, and `error`.
    *   **`useEffect`:** Fetches workout programs from IndexedDB on mount.
    *   **Loading/Error/Empty States:** Displays appropriate messages.
    *   **Program Display:** Iterates through programs and renders a list item for each.
    *   **Accessibility:** Uses `role` and `aria-label` attributes.
    *   **Styling:** Uses CSS Modules.
    *   **Issue:** 2 failing tests related to rendering the program list in `ProgramList.test.tsx`. The specific failing tests need further investigation.
    *   **Suggestion:** Add JSDoc comments.

*   **`src/components/WorkoutDetails/WorkoutDetails.tsx` Analysis:**
    *   **Structure:** Functional component using `useState` and `useEffect`.
    *   **Props:** Accepts a `programId` prop.
    *   **State:** `program`, `isLoading`, and `error`.
    *   **`useEffect`:** Fetches the workout program from IndexedDB using `getWorkoutProgram` when the `programId` changes.
    * **Loading/Error/Empty States:** Displays appropriate messages for loading, error, and not found states.
    * **Workout and Exercise Display:** Uses nested components (`WorkoutComponent` and `ExerciseComponent`) to display details.
    * **Workout History:** Displays a list of workout sessions from the program's history.
    *   **Accessibility:** Uses `role` and `aria-label` for various sections and elements.
    *   **Styling:** Uses CSS Modules.
    *   **Issue:** Failing tests in `WorkoutDetails.test.tsx`. The specific failing tests need further investigation.
    *   **Suggestion:** Add JSDoc comments.
    * **Issue:** As per `.clinerules` and previous analysis, the logic for updating workout history should be in `WorkoutSession`'s `handleFinishWorkout` function, not in `WorkoutDetails`.

### Recommendations

1.  **Fix Failing Tests:**
    *   Address the failing tests in `ExcelUploader.test.tsx`, `ProgramList.test.tsx`, and `App.test.tsx`.
2.  **Move `handleFinishWorkout` Logic:**
    *   Move the logic for updating the workout program's history from `WorkoutDetails.tsx` to `WorkoutSession.tsx`.
3.  **Improve Error Messages:**
    *   Use more generic error messages and provide more context in the console log.
4.  **Add JSDoc Comments:**
    *   Add more JSDoc comments to the functions and components.
5.  **Address Warnings:**
    *   Address the warnings about deprecated `ReactDOMTestUtils.act` and React Router future flags.
6.  **Update Dependencies:**
    *   Update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities and deprecation warnings.
