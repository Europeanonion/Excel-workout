*   Provide exact code changes for manual application.

## Further Analysis (Before Implementation)

### Test Coverage

To assess test coverage, run the following command:

```
npm test -- --coverage
```

Review the generated coverage report to identify any areas of the code that are not adequately covered by tests.  Add or modify tests as needed to improve coverage.

### Edge Cases

*   **WorkoutDetails:**
    *   **Empty program:**  Ensure the component handles the case where the `programId` does not correspond to an existing program in IndexedDB.  It should display an appropriate message to the user (e.g., "Program not found").
    *   **Program with no workouts:**  Ensure the component handles the case where a program has no workouts defined. It should display a message indicating that there are no workouts for the program.
    *   **Workout with no exercises:** Ensure the component handles workouts with no exercises.
    *   **Invalid programId:**  Consider what happens if the `programId` is not a valid UUID.
*   **WorkoutSession:**
    *   **No exercises:** Ensure the component handles the case where the workout has no exercises. It should probably display a message and prevent the user from starting a session.
    *   **Zero working sets:**  Ensure the component handles exercises with `workingSets` set to 0.
    *   **Invalid input:**  Validate user input for reps, load, and RPE to prevent non-numeric or out-of-range values.
    *   **Notes with special characters:** Test how notes with special characters (e.g., newlines, quotes) are handled.
    * **Missing program:** Ensure that if the program is not found in IndexedDB during `handleFinishWorkout`, an appropriate error is handled and displayed to the user.

### Error Handling

*   **WorkoutDetails:**
    *   The component already handles errors when loading the program.  Ensure that the error message is user-friendly and provides helpful information.
*   **WorkoutSession:**
    *   Implement error handling for the `storeWorkoutSession`, `getWorkoutProgram`, and `storeWorkoutProgram` calls within `handleFinishWorkout`.  Display user-friendly error messages if any of these operations fail.
*   **IndexedDB:**
    *   Review the `indexedDB.ts` file to ensure that all IndexedDB operations have comprehensive error handling.

### User Experience

*   **WorkoutDetails:**
    *   Consider adding a visual indicator (e.g., a spinner or loading message) while the program is being loaded.
    *   If there's an error loading the program, provide a clear and informative error message, possibly with a "Retry" button.
*   **WorkoutSession:**
    *   Provide clear visual feedback to the user when a set is added or when input values are changed.
    *   Consider adding a confirmation dialog before finishing the workout to prevent accidental data loss.
    *   After finishing the workout, consider redirecting the user back to the `WorkoutDetails` view or displaying a success message.
    *   The "Add Set" button could be disabled if the number of sets added equals the `workingSets` value for the exercise.
    *   Consider adding input validation to prevent the user from entering invalid values for reps, load, and RPE (e.g., negative numbers, non-numeric values).
    *   Consider adding a way to edit or delete sets.

# Current Mode
PLAN MODE
In this mode you should focus on information gathering, asking questions, and architecting a solution. Once you have a plan, use the plan_mode_response tool to engage in a conversational back and forth with the user. Do not use the plan_mode_response tool until you've gathered all the information you need e.g. with read_file or ask_followup_question.
(Remember: If it seems the user wants you to use tools only available in Act Mode, you should ask the user to "toggle to Act mode" (use those words) - they will have to manually do this themselves with the Plan/Act toggle button below. You do not have the ability to switch to Act Mode yourself, and must wait for the user to do it themselves once they are satisfied with the plan.)
