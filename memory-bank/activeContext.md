I've cleaned up the memory bank files to provide a better overview of the project and remove redundant information. The following changes were made:

1. **Merged Files**:
   - Merged projectbrief.md into productContext.md
   - Merged techContext.md into systemPatterns.md

2. **Removed Redundant Information**:
   - Removed duplicate information from progress.md
   - Streamlined the content to focus on what's important for development

3. **Updated Content**:
   - Updated progress.md to clearly show what works and what's next
   - Updated productContext.md to include core requirements and goals
   - Updated systemPatterns.md to include technical details and architecture

These changes make the memory bank more concise and easier to navigate, providing a clearer picture of the project's current state and future direction.
