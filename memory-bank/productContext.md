# Product Context: Excel Workout PWA

## Why This Project Exists

Many people use Excel spreadsheets to plan and track their workouts. However, Excel is not ideal for use during workouts, especially on mobile devices. This PWA aims to bridge the gap between workout planning in Excel and convenient tracking on a mobile device.

## Problems It Solves

*   **Mobile-Unfriendly Workout Tracking:** Excel is cumbersome to use on a phone during a workout.
*   **Offline Access:**  Users may not always have internet access in their workout environment (e.g., a gym).
*   **Data Synchronization:**  Users need a way to keep their workout data synchronized between devices and potentially back up their data.
*   **Progress Visualization:** Excel doesn't provide easy ways to visualize workout progress over time.

## How It Should Work

1.  Users upload their Excel workout files.
2.  The PWA parses the Excel data and stores it locally in IndexedDB.
3.  Users select a workout program and track their progress (sets, reps, load, RPE, notes).
4.  Workout history is stored locally and synchronized with Firebase Firestore when online.
5.  Users can view their progress over time.

## User Experience Goals

*   **Intuitive and Easy to Use:** The app should be simple to navigate and use, even during a workout.
*   **Fast and Responsive:**  The app should load quickly and respond instantly to user interactions.
*   **Visually Appealing:**  The app should have a clean and modern design.
*   **Reliable:**  Data should be stored securely and reliably, both offline and online.
* **Accessible:** The PWA should be accessible for users with disabilities.
