# Progress: Excel Workout PWA

## What Works

* Basic project setup with Create React App.
* `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` configured.
* Basic file structure created (`public/`, `src/`, `src/types`, `src/features/excelParsing`, `src/components`).
* Core memory bank files created and updated.
* Excel parsing implemented with:
  * Dynamic header mapping
  * Type-safe data handling
  * Comprehensive error handling
  * Full test coverage
  * Proper UUID generation
* IndexedDB integration for storing workout programs
* Firebase integration for cloud storage and authentication:
  * Firebase configuration and initialization
  * User authentication (register, login, logout)
  * Firestore data service for workout programs
  * Synchronization between IndexedDB and Firestore
  * Online/offline detection and status indicator
  * Authentication components (context, forms, pages)
* UI components:
  * ExcelUploader component with:
    * Accessibility support
    * File validation (extension, MIME type, size)
    * Drag and drop support
    * Reset button and template download
    * Progress indicator for file processing
    * Improved error messages
  * ProgramList component with:
    * Dynamic loading of workout programs
    * Loading states and error handling
    * Program statistics display
    * Accessibility features
    * Responsive design
  * WorkoutDetails component with:
    * Navigation from ProgramList
    * Data fetching from IndexedDB
    * Display of workout and exercise details
    * Basic workout history view
  * WorkoutSession component with:
    * Integration with WorkoutDetails
    * Set tracking interface with drag-and-drop reordering
    * Overall workout progress tracking with visual indicators
    * Exercise-specific progress tracking
    * Custom rest timer with global and per-exercise options
    * Note-taking functionality for exercises and sessions
    * Proper workout history tracking in IndexedDB
    * Visual feedback for completed sets

## Current Status

Project initialization and core functionality are complete. Excel parsing and local storage are working, and all tests are now passing. UI components for file upload, program listing, workout details, and session tracking are implemented with proper error handling, accessibility support, and test coverage.

The Excel parser improvements have been implemented, enhancing the user experience with features like drag and drop file upload, file validation, reset button, template download, and better error messages. The code has been refactored to use a custom hook for better reusability and maintainability.

Firebase integration has been completed according to the implementation plan. The application now supports user authentication, cloud storage with Firestore, and synchronization between local IndexedDB and Firestore. We've implemented online/offline detection with a status indicator, allowing users to continue using the application even when offline. The data will automatically synchronize when the connection is restored.

Router configuration issues have been fixed by removing duplicate BrowserRouter components from the application.

## TODO

* Address npm package vulnerabilities and deprecation warnings. `npm audit` shows 23 vulnerabilities (16 moderate, 7 high). `npm audit fix` did not resolve them. `npm audit fix --force` is required for many, but might introduce breaking changes. The `xlsx` package has high severity vulnerabilities with no fix available.
* Configure PWA for offline access:
  * Configure service worker with Workbox for caching
  * Update web app manifest with appropriate icons and metadata
  * Create installation prompt component
  * Implement caching strategies for different resource types
* Add iOS-specific optimizations:
  * Add iOS-specific meta tags and icons
  * Implement IndexedDB retry mechanism for Safari
  * Create iOS splash screens
* Implement performance optimizations:
  * Implement code splitting with React.lazy and Suspense
  * Optimize assets and implement lazy loading
  * Add performance monitoring
