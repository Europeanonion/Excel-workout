# Progress: Excel Workout PWA

## What Works

*   Basic project setup with Create React App.
*   `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` configured.
*   Basic file structure created (`public/`, `src/`, `src/types`, `src/features/excelParsing`, `src/components`).
*   Core memory bank files created and updated.
*   Development plan created and refined.
*   Excel parsing implemented with:
    * Dynamic header mapping
    * Type-safe data handling
    * Comprehensive error handling
    * Full test coverage
*   IndexedDB integration for storing workout programs
*   Basic UI components:
    * ExcelUploader component with accessibility support
    * Success/error message handling
    * Loading states
    * CSS Modules for styling
    * Responsive design
    * High contrast mode support
    * ProgramList component with:
        * Dynamic loading of workout programs
        * Loading states and error handling
        * Program statistics display
        * Accessibility features
        * Responsive design
        * High contrast mode support
    * WorkoutDetails component with:
        * Navigation from ProgramList
        * Data fetching from IndexedDB
        * Display of workout and exercise details
        * Basic workout history view
        * Accessibility features
    * Component integration with automatic list refresh
    * Comprehensive test coverage


## What's Left to Build

*   **UI Components:** Build remaining React components for:
    * Progress tracking interface
*   **IndexedDB Integration:** Implement the logic for storing and retrieving data from IndexedDB using the `idb` library.
*   **Firebase Integration:** Implement the logic for synchronizing data with Firestore.
*   **User Interface:** Build the React components for displaying workout data, tracking progress, and managing multiple workout programs.
*   **Progress Tracking:** Implement the logic for calculating and storing workout history.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling throughout the application.
*   **Loading States:** Implement loading indicators and handle loading states gracefully.
*   **Testing:** Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
*   **iOS Specific Optimizations:**  Address iOS-specific considerations (PWA installation, IndexedDB retries, background sync limitations).
*   **Service Worker Caching:** Implement a caching strategy using Workbox.
*   **Authentication (Optional):** Implement user authentication using Firebase Authentication.


## Current Status

Project initialization and core functionality are complete. Excel parsing and local storage are working with full test coverage. Basic UI components for file upload, program listing, and workout details are implemented with proper error handling, accessibility support, and test coverage. The application can now handle the full flow from Excel file upload to program display and viewing workout details. Ready to begin implementing the workout tracking interface (session tracking).

## Known Issues

*   Potential redundant IndexedDB update in `WorkoutDetails.tsx` (`startWorkout` function).


## TODO
* Address npm package vulnerabilities and deprecation warnings. `npm audit` shows 23 vulnerabilities (16 moderate, 7 high). `npm audit fix` did not resolve them. `npm audit fix --force` is required for many, but might introduce breaking changes. The `xlsx` package has high severity vulnerabilities with no fix available.
