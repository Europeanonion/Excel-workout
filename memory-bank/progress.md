# Progress: Excel Workout PWA

## What Works

*   Basic project setup with Create React App.
*   `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` configured.
*   Basic file structure created (`public/`, `src/`, `src/types`, `src/features/excelParsing`, `src/components`).
*   Core memory bank files created and updated.
*   Development plan created and refined.
*   Excel parsing implemented with:
    * Dynamic header mapping
    * Type-safe data handling
    * Comprehensive error handling
    * Full test coverage
*   IndexedDB integration for storing workout programs
*   Basic UI components:
    * ExcelUploader component with accessibility support
    * Success/error message handling
    * Loading states
    * CSS Modules for styling
    * Responsive design
    * High contrast mode support
    * ProgramList component with:
        * Dynamic loading of workout programs
        * Loading states and error handling
        * Program statistics display
        * Accessibility features
        * Responsive design
        * High contrast mode support
    * WorkoutDetails component with:
        * Navigation from ProgramList
        * Data fetching from IndexedDB
        * Display of workout and exercise details
        * Basic workout history view
        * Accessibility features
    * WorkoutSession component with:
        * Integration with WorkoutDetails
        * Basic structure for session tracking
    * Component integration with automatic list refresh
    * Comprehensive test coverage


## What's Left to Build

*   **Test Fixes:**
    *   Address failing tests in `App.test.tsx`, `WorkoutDetails.test.tsx`, and `WorkoutSession.test.tsx`.
    *   Run tests with cache clearing (`npm test -- --clearCache`).
*   **WorkoutSession Enhancements:**
    * Implement set tracking interface.
    * Add progress indicators.
    * Include note-taking functionality.
*   **State Management:**
    * Evaluate state complexity and consider implementing Zustand if needed.
    * Set up proper state persistence within `WorkoutSession`.
*   **Firebase Integration:** Implement the logic for synchronizing data with Firestore.
*   **Progress Tracking:** Implement the logic for calculating and storing workout history (fully, within `WorkoutSession`).
*   **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling throughout the application.
*   **Loading States:** Implement loading indicators and handle loading states gracefully.
*   **iOS Specific Optimizations:**  Address iOS-specific considerations (PWA installation, IndexedDB retries, background sync limitations).
*   **Service Worker Caching:** Implement a caching strategy using Workbox.
*   **Authentication (Optional):** Implement user authentication using Firebase Authentication.


## Current Status

Project initialization and core functionality are complete. Excel parsing and local storage are working, but there are failing tests in `App.test.tsx`, `WorkoutDetails.test.tsx`, and `WorkoutSession.test.tsx`. Basic UI components for file upload, program listing, workout details, and session tracking are implemented with proper error handling, accessibility support, and test coverage. The application can now handle the full flow from Excel file upload to program display, viewing workout details, and starting a workout session. The immediate next step is to address the failing tests before proceeding with Firebase integration and other enhancements.

## Known Issues

*   Potential redundant IndexedDB update in `WorkoutDetails.tsx` (logic should be moved to `WorkoutSession`'s `handleFinishWorkout` function).

## TODO

*   Address npm package vulnerabilities and deprecation warnings. `npm audit` shows 23 vulnerabilities (16 moderate, 7 high). `npm audit fix` did not resolve them. `npm audit fix --force` is required for many, but might introduce breaking changes. The `xlsx` package has high severity vulnerabilities with no fix available.
