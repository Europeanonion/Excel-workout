# Project Brief: Excel Workout PWA

## Core Requirements

This project aims to develop a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that allows users to upload Excel workout files and convert them into a mobile-friendly workout tracking app. The application must work offline on iOS devices and synchronize data when online.

## Goals

*   Provide a seamless and intuitive user experience for tracking workouts.
*   Support multiple Excel workout file formats through dynamic header mapping.
*   Ensure data integrity and handle potential synchronization conflicts.
*   Offer a robust offline-first experience, optimized for iOS Safari.
*   Enable users to track their progress over time.

## Scope

The initial scope includes:

*   Excel file parsing (.xlsx).
*   Offline data storage using IndexedDB.
*   Data synchronization with Firebase Firestore.
*   Basic workout tracking features (sets, reps, load, RPE, notes).
*   Progress tracking (total load, load per set, reps completed, timestamp, notes).
*   iOS PWA compatibility.
